# Welcome to [Salam Labs (beta)](https://https://starlit-dusk-920033.netlify.app/)

This is a beta website. The outcome of this will result in [salamlabs.io](https://salamlabs.io)

[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/dolosarafat/salam-app-web) 🥶❄️👌

Press the period button on your keyboard to open it on [github.dev](https://github.dev) 🤮🤢 but I have no idea why we would choose that over gitpod


Astro things


## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
